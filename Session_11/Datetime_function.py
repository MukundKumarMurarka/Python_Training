Day first format
By default, to_datetime() will parse string with month first (MM/DD, MM DD, or MM-DD) format, and this arrangement 
is relatively unique in the United State.
In most of the rest of the world, the day is written first (DD/MM, DD MM, or DD-MM). 
If you would like Pandas to consider day first instead of month, you can set the argument dayfirst to True.
