"""
Exceptions: Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct, but the code resulted in an error.
This error does not stop the execution of the program, however, it changes the normal flow of the program.
eception is occured due to wrong input given by user.
Exception handling : -  the process by which we handle the exception is known as exception handling .
there are two blocks in exception handling.
1. try block : in this block we know that we get error. error occur by giving the wrong input
2. except block :- in this block we catch the error and out logic to handle the error, so that our code is run properly.

 for example

"""
Python provides a keyword finally, which is always executed after the try and except blocks. 
The final block always executes after normal termination of try block or after try block terminates due to some exception.
Syntax:

try:
    # Some Code.... 

except:
    # optional block
    # Handling of exception (if required)

else:
    # execute if no exception

finally:

"""
#example of exception with finally keyword :

try:
    result1 = (e + f) / (e - f)
