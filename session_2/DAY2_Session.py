# CONDITIONAL STATEMNT, LOOPING STATEMENT, OPERATORS IN PYTHON

# IF STATEMENT, ELIF STATEMENT, IF ELSE STATEMENT
# IF STATEMENT is executed when the condition is true
# for example check between a and b which is greater
a = 10
b = 5
if a > b:  # check condition is true or false
    print(a)  # conditionn is true the if lock is executed

# if else statement :- else statement is executed when the condition is false
# for example check which one is larger between c and d
c = 15
d = 17
if c > d:
    print(c, " is larger")
else:
    print(d, " is larger")

# elif :- elif statement is used when ther is need of more then one if else statement
# for example chevk which one larger among three number
e = 12
f = 13
g = 18
if e > f and e > g:
    print(e, "is larger among three number")
elif f > e and f > g:
    print(f, "is larger among three number")
else:
    print(g, "is larger among three number")

# Nestes if :- Nested if means that if inside the if block
# for example:- first check a number is even or odd if number is even then check it is greater then 5 or not
h = 8
if h % 2 == 0:
    print(h, " is even number")
    if h >= 5:
        print("yes", h, " is greater then 5")
    else:
        print("no", h, " is not greater then 5")
else:
    print(h, " is odd number")

# LOOPING STATEMENT IN PYTHON
# FOR LOOP IN PYTHON
# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence
# With the for loop we can execute a set of statements once for each tem ina list,set tuple, set etc
# for example :- print 1 to 10 number by using for loop

for i in range(10):
    print(i, end=" ")
print(" ")

# if statement inside for loop
# for example print the value from 1 to 20 which is not divisible by 5
for i in range(20):
    if i % 5 != 0:
        print(i, end=" ")
print(" ")

# while loop :- this loop is as same as for loop the basic deffrence is that in while loop initialization,
# condition check and increment all is done manually but in for loop all is done automatically

i = 0  # initialization of i
while i <= 10:  # condition check
    print(i, end=" ")
    i = i + 1  # incrimenting of i
print(" ")
# while loop with if statment
j = 0
while j <= 20:
    if j % 5 != 0:
        print(j, end=" ")
    j = j + 1
print(" ")

# OPERATORS:- Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. operator is type of operation which
# is happend on variable variable on which operation is done is called operand whole the process is know as
# operation. Python divides the operators in the following groups: # Arithmetic operators:- All the mathematical
# orerator is comes under Arithmetic operator fir examole :- +(Addition),-(substraction),*(Multiplication),
# %(Modulas),/(devide),//(floor) ,**(square)
h = 10
k = 3
print(h + k)  # Addition operator
print(h - k)  # Substraction operator
print(h * k)  # multiplication operator
print(h / k)  # divide operator
print(h // k)  # floor operator
print(h % k)  # modulas operator

# # Assignment operators:- Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
# =	    x = 5	x = 5	 Assign 5 to x
# +=	x += 3	x = x + 3 add 3 in x
# -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	substract 3 in x
# *=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	multiply 3 in x
# /=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	divide x by 3
# %=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	find modulas of x by 3
# //=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	floor x by 3
# **=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	taking cube root of x
# &=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	fing AND of x with 3
# |=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	finding OR of x with 3
# ^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	finding XOR of x withh 3
# >>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	 finding left shift of x by 3
# <<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3    finding right shift of x by 3

# # Comparison operators :- This operator is used to compair two variables:
# ==	Equal	x == y
# !=	Not equal	x != y
# >	Greater than	x > y
# <	Less than	x < y
# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y
# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y
# for example
l = 14
m = 19
if l == m:
    print("both are equal")
if l != m:
    print("both are not equal")
if l >= m:
    print(l, "is greater than ", m)
if l <= m:
    print(l, " is less than ", m)

# # Logical operators:- Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:
# and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10
# or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4
# not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)


# # Identity operators:-Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are
# actually the same object, with the same memory location: is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x
# is y is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y


# # Membership operators:- Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:
# in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y
# not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y


# # Bitwise operators:- Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers & 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both
# bits are 1 |	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1 ^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is
# 1 ~ 	NOT	Inverts all the bits <<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the
# leftmost bits fall off >>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left,
# and let the rightmost bits fall off
