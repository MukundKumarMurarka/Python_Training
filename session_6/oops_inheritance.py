Inheritance :- Derive a new class from exixting class.
               the class from which a class is derived is known as parent class, and class the which is derived
               we can use all the variables and method of parent class in the chil class but the viceversa is not true
                if we declare init method in parent class and child class both and creating the objects of child class
                then it will first check that init method is in the child class or not if it is availablr then object
                will call thw init method of child class. if there is no any init method in child class then object will
                call init method of parent class.
